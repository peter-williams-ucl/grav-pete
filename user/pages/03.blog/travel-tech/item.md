I like playing video games. I like playing the Total War game series. I play that on a laptop. It is easier on a laptop than on the phone. You can’t move the armies around on  phone.
Also I play games on tablet and Xbox 1. On my tablet I play board games and card games. I also play a lt of shooting games on my xbox, like Players Unknown Battleground (PUBg) I also like listening to music on my phone, like Spotify. 
Most of my stuff is digital now … like my Kindle
I like my kindle (paperwhite) for reading.
