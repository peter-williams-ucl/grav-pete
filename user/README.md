## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Striped theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-striped)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Striped Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install striped
```
